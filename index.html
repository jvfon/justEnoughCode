        A programming language allows you to make logical decisions in your 
        code. It gives instructions to computers.

        PHP is a programming language that allows you to take a website or 
        web page and turn it into a web app. A web app is basically a website 
        that does something. PHP was designed to build web apps. PHP 
        originally stood for “personal home page” but now stands for 
        “hypertext preprocessor”.

        An example of PHP based web app: Facebook. Facebook allows you to post 
        photos, post updates, see other ppls updates, etc.

        One of the thing PHP can also do is to check if a form with an email 
        address was written correctly and make a decision based on that. If the 
        email address is correct, PHP can put it in a database. If the email 
        address is wrong, a message can appear on the website telling the user to 
        correct the email address.

        A PHP file is an HTML file with PHP code inside. Has an open and closing 
        PHP tag:
