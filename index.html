    <h1>PHP Basics - Concepts</h1>
    <p>
        A programming language allows you to make logical decisions in your 
        code. It gives instructions to computers.
    </p>
    <p>
        PHP is a programming language that allows you to take a website or 
        web page and turn it into a web app. A web app is basically a website 
        that does something. PHP was designed to build web apps. PHP 
        originally stood for “personal home page” but now stands for 
        “hypertext preprocessor”. 
    </p>
    <p>
        An example of PHP based web app: Facebook. Facebook allows you to post 
        photos, post updates, see other ppls updates, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the thing PHP can also do is to check if a form with an email 
        address was written correctly and make a decision based on that. If the 
        email address is correct, PHP can put it in a database. If the email 
        address is wrong, a message can appear on the website telling the user to 
        correct the email address.       
    </p>
    <p>
        A PHP file is an HTML file with PHP code inside. Has an open and closing 
        PHP tag:     
    </p>
    <p>
        <body>
            <?php 
                echo “this is PHP code”;
            php>
        </body>          
    </p>
    <p>
        PHP is a server side programming language. It processes PHP code in the 
        server. In order to make PHP work we need a server. MAMP is an app that 
        makes a computer act as a server. The computer becomes a local server.        
    </p>
    <p>
        Got to https://www.mamp.info/en/  download it. It comes with Apache, MySQL
         and PHP. Install the app in a place that’s easy to find.       
    </p>
    <p>
        To find out where the PHP files should go:
    </p>
    <p>
        On the MAMP app click on “MAMP”, a pull down menu appears, then click on 
        “Preferences...”, a new window pops up and finally click on “Web Server”. 
        Under “document root” you should see were the PHP files should go. If you 
        chose your C drive to install your files then C:\MAMP\htdocs is where you 
        should place those files. The “open” will take you to that directory.
    </p>
